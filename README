As I mentioned before, I changed my mind. Instead of a particle system I implemented screen spaced ambient occlusion. The final result is really god but I want to improve it, make it look like the original (Crytek implementation, sahshshsaahs).

The code looks really simple, but I spent A LOT of time on this, and was totally worth it.

Instructions of how to use it:
	Just compile using make and run it. The file scene.xml should be in the folder of the executable, and the shader folder as well.

Aknowledge:
	I'm using glm library, tinyobjloader founded here https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader and rapidxml.
